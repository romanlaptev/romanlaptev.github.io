- One last night,

which resulted in your rescue,

it's a pleasure.

A few weeks
after your capture,

498

a direct action mission against
a former police H.Q. in Garma.

[ Fades ]
According to your debrief,
most of your incarceration...

500
00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:05.608
was spent at a secret
military facility
outside Damascus.

501
00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:09.195
What landmarks
or structural details can you
give us to help pinpoint-

502
00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:13.157
Eight months ago, you were
smuggled overland to an enemy
operating base in Afghanistan.

503

Now, after so many years,

my name is Carrie Mathison.

l served as a case officer
in lraq.

Your picture
was on our M.l.A. wall.

to find you sooner.

510
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.968
l'd like to start with the first
few days of your captivity,
if you don't mind.

511
00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:37.098
- Not at all.
- How soon after you were taken
did the interrogations begin?

512
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.558
Pretty much right away.

513
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:41.477
What did they want to know?

514
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:44.063
Anything l could tell 'em
about U.S. ground operations-

515
00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:47.066
supply routes,
communication codes,
rules of engagement.

516
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.776
When you were debriefed
in Germany,

517
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.070
you said you gave up
no such information.

518
00:33:52.114 --> 00:33:54.532

was excellent.

And Corporal Walker?

520
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:59.286
- Ma'am?
- Did he give anything up?

521
00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:04.083
We were never
interrogated together,
so I don't know.

522
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:07.545
But still, you must have
wondered, especially after
you learned of his death.

523
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:09.880
l'm assuming there's
a point to all this, Carrie.

524
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:11.549
There is, sir.

525
00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:14.885
As you know, the first 72 hours
after a soldier's capture
are critical.

526
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:19.056
What he knows can be used
by the enemy during that period
to devastating effect.

527
00:34:19.141 --> 00:34:21.142
The point is,
Sergeant Brody stopped
being a source...

528
00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:23.310
of actionable intelligence
fairly quickly,

529
00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:26.689
and yet he was kept alive
for almost eight more years.

530
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:28.816
l'd like to ask him
if he knows why.

531
00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:32.820

Who was your interrogator?

533
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.662

His name was Zayadi.

Zayadi?

his name was anyway.
